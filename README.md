    Linux Device Drivers
</h1>

# Why

Linux Device Drivers are essential to provide integration between the operating system and the device, enabling the hardware and software to work together as intended.

( `WIP` ðŸš§ ) This project serves as a "guide" or a step-by-step process to get a simple I2C/SPI device working as a Linux Device Driver.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> This project uses the Raspberry Pi 400, but it can be adapted for other boards if necessary.

# How

Each directory contains its own instructions in the respective README files. The ideas and code are strongly based on the YouTube playlist by *Johannes 4GNU_Linux* and the book *Linux Device Drivers, Third Edition*.

# What

This project is mainly intended for educational purposes, following the YouTube playlist, the LDD book, and various online resources.
